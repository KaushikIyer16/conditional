# conditional

while optional exists in Java, there is no generic condtional functional equivalent in java. This proposal aims in bridging that gap. some of the benefits include:

* restricted mutations.
* composable lambda's instead of verbose method.
* ease in decomposing large functions.
* makes code look more cleaner
